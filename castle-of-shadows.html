        <h2>Castle of Shadows</h2>
        <img src="images/castle-of-shadows.png" alt="castle-of-shadows" class="chapter-image">
        <p>As dusk gives way to the encroaching gloom, you find yourself at the threshold of the Castle of Shadows, an
            architectural nightmare sprung from the darkest of fables. The castle's towering spires stretch upwards,
            clawing at the tempestuous clouds swirling above like serpents writhing in the sky. The very air around the
            castle writhes with a brooding sentience, saturated with whispers of lament from an unseeable choir.
        </p>
        <p>The environment oppresses with a tangible dread, a canvas where reality seems painted with strokes of madness
            and despair. Your every breath materializes in the frigid air, and the ground beneath you, strewn with the
            detritus of fallen leaves and bones, crunches in reluctant symphony with your hesitant steps. The castle's
            visage is a manifestation of terror, its form an amalgam of Gothic elegance and barbaric splendor. Vines,
            like the desiccated veins of a long-dead giant, encase the ancient stonework that throbs with the pulse of
            secrets long buried.
        </p>
        <p>In the spectral twilight, the Queen of Sorrows is a vision of tragedy incarnate, her figure a ghastly mirage
            that floats before the castle's forbidding gates. Her eyes are bottomless wells of despair, her whispers, a
            cold caress that threatens to freeze your soul. She presents a riddle wrapped in the tragedy of her reign, a
            tapestry of sorrow that invites you to trace its threads through the castle's haunted halls.
        </p>
        <p>Deep within the stone belly of this fortress lies a cursed treasure, its allure as intoxicating as the peril
            it promises. It is said to be a relic that ensnares the senses, promising riches beyond imagining, yet its
            grasp is a vise of nightmares that threatens to crush the sanity of those who covet it. The treasure, a
            chimera of splendor and fear, promises a fate entwined with shadow and decay.
        </p>
        <p>The Forgotten Library, a sepulcher of knowledge and insanity, reeks of the rot of ancient tomes and the
            biting tang of inks long dried. Here, the very air seems to shiver with the weight of knowledge too terrible
            to fathom. The books, bound in leathery skins of indeterminate origin, yearn to share their eldritch tales,
            to ensnare you in their loathsome revelations.
        </p>
        <p>Now, at the heart of the Castle of Shadows, you are called to navigate a landscape of the surreal and the
            substantial, where each choice is a thread in the ominous tapestry of this narrative. Whether to delve into
            the mournful mystery of a queen ensnared by her own spectral chains, to brave the seductive peril of a
            treasure steeped in damnation, or to risk sanity itself in the pursuit of truths best left unspoken, your
            path is fraught with peril.
        </p>
        <p>Stand before the yawning maw of history and horror. Do you:
