        <h2>Castle of Shadows</h2>
        <img src="images/castle-of-shadows.png" alt="castle-of-shadows" class="chapter-image">
        <p>As you emerge into the realm of the Castle of Shadows, an eerie castle looms in the distance, its spires
            piercing the sky like the jagged teeth of some ancient, slumbering beast. The stillness here is a relentless
            oppressor, and with each footstep, you defy the silence that seeks to suffocate the life from all who enter.
        </p>
        <p>The castle's grim silhouette casts a long shadow over the land, as though it's a monstrous entity with a
            reach as dark as its history. The air is thick, not just with the chill of stone long untouched by warmth,
            but with a menacing presence that seeps from the wallsâ€”walls that have borne witness to unspoken atrocities
            and have absorbed the despair of countless lost souls.
        </p>
        <p>A spectral figure, the Queen of Sorrows, materializes from the umbral mist, her form a wraithlike echo of
            regality and torment. Her gaze pierces you, conveying an abyss of grief that wraps around your mind like a
            shroud. Each whisper from her ethereal lips is a chain, a link to a bygone tragedy, ensnaring you into a
            quest that dances on the knife-edge between redemption and oblivion. Her hand, a ghostly silhouette against
            the looming darkness, beckons you to unwind the labyrinthine tale of her downfall.
        </p>
        <p>In the bowels of the castle, hidden beneath layers of deceit and malice, lies a treasure that sings a siren
            song of fortune, yet is laced with a vile curse. The pursuit of such a relic is to court the very shadows
            that hunger for the unwary, to navigate a maze where the walls themselves harbor malevolent intentions,
            eager to ensnare those who seek what is zealously guarded.
        </p>
        <p>In the castle's oppressive expanse, the Forgotten Library waits, pregnant with the dread of knowledge too
            formidable for the light of day. The air is saturated with the perfume of mouldering books and the acrid
            sting of ancient ink, a library where the volumes, swollen with forbidden lore, are eager to divulge their
            secrets to the daring or the damned. It is a trove where reality's fabric is tattered and threadbare, ready
            to be unraveled by those who dare to read its ensorcelled pages.
        </p>
        <p>The Castle of Shadows presents you with choices that are a macabre dance of the abstract and the corporeal,
            each step a chapter in an unwritten epic of horror and heroism. Whether to console a queen who is an echo of
            the past, to wrest a treasure from the clutches of malevolent specters, or to reveal the awful truths hidden
            within time-worn texts, your decision will stitch a new pattern in the dark quilt of this place.
        </p>
        <p>Stand now at the precipice, between the legends that sleep within these walls and the unseen terror that
            watches from the shadows. Will you:
