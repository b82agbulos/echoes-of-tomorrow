        <h2>Castle of Shadows</h2>
        <img src="images/castle-of-shadows.png" alt="castle-of-shadows" class="chapter-image">


        <p>As you step over the threshold into the Castle of Shadows, the air grows dense with a foreboding silence,
            punctuated only by the distant echo of your footsteps. This ancient fortress, shrouded in mystery and
            whispers of the past, beckons you deeper into its heart, where light fears to tread and shadows dance with
            the remnants of souls long departed.
        </p>
        <p>Navigating the castle's labyrinthine corridors, you become acutely aware of the delicate balance between the
            seen and the unseen, where every shadow could be a cloak for the castle's ghostly inhabitants. These
            spectral figures, remnants of a bygone era, glide silently through the walls, their presence felt more than
            seen, a testament to the castle's storied past.
        </p>
        <p>In the heart of this spectral fortress, you encounter the ghostly visage of a queen, her demeanor regal yet
            tinged with an eternal sorrow. Her eyes, glowing with a spectral light, peer into your very soul, offering a
            glimpse into the castle's hidden depths. She proposes a trade: a task for you to complete in exchange for
            the secrets that pulse like a heartbeat within these walls. Her offer holds the promise of untold knowledge,
            yet carries the weight of unknown consequences.
        </p>
        <p>Alternatively, the allure of the castle's cursed treasure calls to you, a whisper of wealth and power that is
            as intoxicating as it is perilous. To seek this treasure is to challenge the very foundations of the castle,
            to risk awakening curses old as the stones themselves. The treasure promises great reward, but it is guarded
            by trials that test the courage and cunning of any who dare to claim it.
        </p>
        <p>Beyond the echoing halls and shadowed chambers lies the Forgotten Library, a sanctum of arcane knowledge
            where time itself seems to stand still. This repository of wisdom, hidden from the world for centuries,
            holds within its dust-laden shelves and ancient volumes secrets that whisper of powers beyond the ken of
            mortals. As you navigate its silent aisles, the air thick with the scent of time-worn parchment, the very
            essence of the place beckons you deeper into its heart. Here, among the relics of a bygone era, lies the
            intrigue of forgotten lore, each tome a gateway to mysteries untold, promising insights into realms
            uncharted and unknown.
        </p>
        <p>The Castle of Shadows, with its haunted halls and spectral denizens, is a place of choices, each path veiled
            in shadow and mystery. Whether you seek the wisdom of the ghostly queen, brave the dangers of the cursed
            treasure, or delve into the arcane mysteries of the Forgotten Library, the choices you make will echo
            through the corridors of the castle and beyond. Here, in the nexus of past and present, your decisions shape
            the narrative, weaving a tale of adventure, mystery, and the eternal quest for knowledge.
        </p>
