        <h2>Castle of Shadows</h2>
        <img src="images/castle-of-shadows.png" alt="castle-of-shadows" class="chapter-image">

        <p>Crossing the threshold of the Castle of Shadows, you enter a silence so profound it seems to devour sound
            itself. The fortress, a relic of antiquity, is a labyrinth of stone, where light shrinks back and the dance
            of shadows suggests figures draped in history's veil.
        </p>
        <p>Through the dimly lit passageways, a chill seeps into your bones—not merely the cold of night but a presence
            that skirts the edges of perception. These are not mere shadows; they are echoes of lives once lived,
            specters bound to the castle's fate, silent watchers of the passage of eons.
        </p>
        <p>In the castle's heart, a spectral queen materializes, her form luminous and sorrowful. Her gaze, piercing yet
            sorrowful, seems to pull at the threads of your spirit, hinting at buried secrets. She offers you a bargain
            wrapped in enigma—complete her cryptic task, and the castle's hidden knowledge is yours. Her words are a
            siren's song, yet the air around her shimmers with the silent hum of unseen risks.
        </p>
        <p>Elsewhere, the promise of the castle's accursed treasure whispers through the stone, a sibilant temptation of
            wealth laced with danger. To seek this treasure is to challenge the very essence of the castle, stirring
            curses as old as the bedrock. The reward is great, yet the guardians of this treasure are trials of valor
            and wit, each a sentinel against the greed of man.
        </p>
        <p>Venture further, and you find the Forgotten Library, a sanctum of knowledge where time's passage holds no
            sway. Within its hallowed confines, the air is laden with the musk of ancient tomes. Each book, a relic of
            forgotten wisdom, is a portal to worlds unseen, promising the allure of untold power and forgotten truths.
        </p>
        <p>The Castle of Shadows, a nexus of history and legend, presents paths shrouded in the enigmatic twilight of
            choice. Whether you commune with the spectral queen, dare the perilous quest for the cursed treasure, or
            seek the esoteric secrets within the library's hallowed halls, the path you choose will reverberate through
            the silent stone of the castle and shape the tale of your journey—a tale of bravery, of mystery, and the
            ceaseless pursuit of the unknown.
        </p>
        <p>As you navigate this gothic domain, let the shadows be a reminder that fear and curiosity are but two sides
            of the same coin, and that true terror lies not in the darkness itself but in the truths it conceals. Here,
            in the Castle of Shadows, your saga weaves a tale of dread and discovery, an odyssey through the heart of
            fear itself.
