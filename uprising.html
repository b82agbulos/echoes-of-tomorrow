        <h2>Uprising</h2>
        <img src="images/uprising.png" alt="Uprising" class="chapter-image">
        <p>In the city's heart, where steel spires claw at the heavens and neon pulses like the lifeblood of a beast,
            the air thrums with the electric current of change. The dusk has cast its copper glow over the metropolis,
            the City of Tomorrow, transforming it into an ethereal realm where the ordinary collides with the
            spectacular. This is where dreams are forged in the crucible of progress, where hope and despair intertwine
            in the shadow of monolithic constructs that house the aspirations of humankind.
        </p>
        <p>The streets, arteries filled with the ceaseless flow of the determined and the downtrodden, echo with the
            footsteps of revolution. Here, the chant for change rises from the depths, a symphony of discord and
            harmony, as varied as the souls who march upon the rain-slick pavements. The populace, once disparate voices
            in the cacophony of daily struggle, now unite in a singular chorus that resonates through the towering
            canyons of commerce and culture.
        </p>
        <p>At the forefront of this unfolding drama stands you, the unexpected leader whose voice has become a clarion
            call for the oppressed. The heavy mantle of leadership drapes your shoulders, every decision a ripple in the
            pond of destiny, capable of either birthing a tempest or calming the storm.
        </p>
        <p>A decision looms on the horizon, a fork in the proverbial road that will dictate the flow of the rebellion's
            current. To your left lies the path of the stealth assault, a plan crafted in the quiet council of shadowed
            rooms and whispered in hushed tones. This strategy is the blade hidden in the darkness, the silent arrow
            that seeks the heart of an empire built on surveillance and iron-fisted rule. It is the choice of those who
            wield secrecy as their weapon, who believe that the softest footsteps leave the most indelible mark upon the
            halls of power.
        </p>
        <p>To your right shines the path of open rebellion, where the sun rises on the faces of those brave enough to
            stand in the light. This is the way of the drumbeat and the raised banner, the open hand and the clenched
            fist. It is a path paved with the bravery of those willing to lay their convictions bare for the world to
            see, to draw the gaze of tyrants and challenge them beneath the sky's unblinking eye.
        </p>
        <p>Your heart beats a steady rhythm, a metronome against the backdrop of a city holding its breath. The choice
            you make will not only define the battle but will etch your story into the very bones of the city. Will you
            move through the shadows, a ghost of retribution, or will you stand tall in the light of day, a beacon of
            defiance?
        </p>
        <p>The decision is yours, and the city waits, a canvas stretched tight, ready for the brushstroke that will
            define an era. The shadows call with the promise of quiet revolution, while the light beckons with the glory
            of open resistance. Whichever you choose, the path will demand all you have to give and perhaps more. The
            story of the uprising, your story, is yet to be told, and the pen is in your hand.
        </p>
        <p>So, what will it be? Will you embrace the darkness and strike from within, or will you step into the light
            and lead the charge?
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
