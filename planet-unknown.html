        <h2>Planet Unknown</h2>
        <img src="images/planet-unknown.png" alt="Planet Unknown" class="chapter-image">
        <p>Bathed in the diffused light of the twin suns, you find yourself at the edge of the unexplored, a surreal
            landscape sprawling before you. Towering rock spires reach skyward, their harsh lines softened by the gentle
            mists of this otherworldly morning. The terrain is alive with a symphony of rustling foliage and the soft
            calls of distant, unseen fauna.
        </p>
        <p>The ground is a canvas of alien vegetation, where flora in hues unimaginable on Earth pulse with the life
            force of this untouched world. The air is saturated with the scents of this strange botany, hanging heavily
            around you, filled with the thrill of the undiscovered.
        </p>
        <p>Behind you, the colossal spaceship lies in repose—its exterior etched with stories of its voyages through the
            tempests of space, a quiet behemoth from a forgotten epoch. It stands as a testament to humanity's
            relentless quest for understanding, its silent halls and chambers a labyrinth of history and technology.
        </p>
        <p>On the horizon, the view is dominated by enormous planets, so proximate that their swirling atmospheres seem
            almost tangible. They serve as a constant reminder of this planet's place in the cosmic tapestry, a juncture
            of innumerable paths that stretch out into the vastness of space.
        </p>
        <p>Your saga, now bound to the destiny of this world and the silent colossus that rests upon it, is a narrative
            of endurance and introspection. Each direction promises discovery; every choice you make weaves a new strand
            into the narrative of your odyssey.
        </p>
        <p>The moment of choice bears down upon you. Will you navigate the wilds of this world to reawaken the ship, a
            relic from a bygone age of interstellar exploration? Or will you immerse yourself in the secrets of the
            planet, exploring the delicate balance that thrives in the dimming light, navigating the fine line between
            understanding and perpetual wonder?
        </p>
        <p>Each decision is a fulcrum on which possible realities pivot. And as you stand at this junction, the route
            you select will not only carve your fate but also chart the untold tales of those who may one day trace the
            echo of your decisions.
        </p>
