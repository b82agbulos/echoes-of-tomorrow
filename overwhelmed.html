        <h2>Overwhelmed</h2>
        <img src="images/overwhelmed.png" alt="Overwhelmed" class="chapter-image">
        <p>In the final chapter, under a sky littered with the dying embers of stars, you stand—a solitary figure amid
            the ruins of cosmic civilizations. The journey through the decayed echoes of ancient empires and the cold
            expanse of space has etched within you not just a longing but a stark realization of the universe's
            merciless vastness.
        </p>
        <p>The cathedral of stars, once a beacon of enlightenment, now looms over you as a mausoleum of forgotten
            wisdom. The once-vibrant tapestry of reality is now a frayed cloth, stretched over the bones of time. Your
            silhouette, cast in the pallid light of a fading cosmos, is a testament to the isolation of your quest—a
            sanctuary where the fabric of reality unravels into the entropy of the unknown.
        </p>
        <p>As you grapple with the torrents of understanding, their illumination is not warmth but the harsh light of a
            desolate truth. Revelations pirouette like specters in the vacuum, each a reminder of the insatiable void
            waiting to consume all thought and meaning. Your inundation is not a symphony but a dirge, the mournful wail
            of truths too vast and too indifferent for the human mind.
        </p>
        <p>The citadel of your psyche, which once stood firm on humanity's bedrock, now teeters on the precipice of
            oblivion. The flood of astral wisdom, rather than elevating your spirit, threatens to submerge it in the
            dark waters of insanity. Your transformation is not a metamorphosis but an unraveling, as the seer's orbs
            that you now possess gaze into a void that offers no answers, only the echo of endless questions.
        </p>
        <p>You are reborn, not as an oracle of wisdom, but as a harbinger of the cosmic silence. Your speech, once
            embroidered with the filigree of cosmic epiphanies, now carries the weight of a truth too heavy for the
            tongues of mortals. To the layperson, your words are not just riddles but the forewarnings of oblivion, and
            to the discerning, you are no sage but a sentinel of the abyss, signaling the futility of seeking light in
            the inexorable dark. Your existence, once a beacon for seekers of the celestial, now serves as a solemn
            reminder of the isolating pursuit of knowledge in a universe sliding into chaos.
        </p>
        <p>In this realm, where enlightenment bleeds into the void and sanity frays at the edges, your journey is a
            Sisyphean task. You traverse a landscape of cosmic desolation, a custodian of wisdom that the universe
            itself seems eager to forget. The legacy you hoped to inscribe in the heavens now appears as mere scratches
            in the vast, indifferent expanse of space—a whisper drowned out by the cacophony of a dying cosmos.
        </p>
        <p>Your story concludes not with triumph but with a sobering acceptance. The rebirth you underwent is less a
            transformation and more an exposure to the ultimate truth—a realization that the enlightenment you sought is
            overshadowed by the relentless entropy of the universe.
        </p>
        <p>And so, under the waning glow of a billion stars, your silhouette merges with the darkness. Your tale becomes
            one with the silent epic written in the void. It's an ending that lingers in the mind, a contemplation of
            our own place in the cosmos, a stark reminder of the paradox of seeking meaning in the vast, unforgiving
            expanse of an indifferent universe.
        </p>
